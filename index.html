            <p class="title">FRENNFTs - A Frenly Metaverse Built On Bitcoin</p>
            <p>
                The worst thing of the otherwise very fun crypto world, is projects that adopt buzzwords over convictions. People that peddle hype over fundamentals.
                <br><br>
                That's why, right off the bat, I'm going to break down what exactly FRENFT is, and what we're aiming to achieve:
                <div class="lists">
                    <ul class="nes-list is-disc">
                        <li>FRENFTs is a community-focused metaverse project</li>
                        <li>All art assets are licensed under CC0, do what you want with them</li>
                        <li>When you buy an NFT, you own it, outright</li>
                        <li>All assets (<em>art, lore, stats, metadata</em>) are 100% decentralized</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                The ultimate goal of FRENFTs is to show the power of community-creativity. Your FRENFT will be used in a myriad of dapps & activities.
                <br>
                Games, chat rooms, avatars, 3D events, trading options, DeFi utility, club memberships, etc.
                <br>
                The only limit is what people choose to build.
                <br><br>
                There is no VC firm behind this project, it's just a random <a href="https://twitter.com/haxbtc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FREN</a> who gets the ball rolling, and then blends in with the rest of the community. No insider benefits, no rugpull potential, no shenanigans (<em>other than shitposting on twitter</em>).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div style="height: 50px;"></div>

        <div class="nes-container is-rounded is-dark">
            <p>
                <strong>STRONG COMMUNITY</strong>
                <em>Built by a long term crypto user with <a href="https://twitter.com/haxBTC/status/1458962750827237381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy bags</a> and a love for this space, the FRENFTs mission is to show the power of the amazing community, and just like Bitcoin showed what can be achieved when people believed in something good, we aim to show what can be achieved when people get creative with something fun.</em>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <strong>STRONG CONVICTIONS</strong>
                <em>A sad amount of obnoxious behavior is present in the current NFT space. We choose to stand above that by committing to open code, permissive licenses, frenly behavior, and transparent building. Nothing is in the dark. We will build it for all to see. No promises of mooning, just good ol' experimental fun.<br><br>We yearn for the old days of the internet, where people were wild, creative, and productive. FRENFTs will set the standard for rebel indie metaverse greatness.</em>

                        <p>The base NFT is pixel art, because the goal is to allow for ultimate customization, modability, and modification. Using a "lowrez" pixel art sprite allows future developers to modify these NFTs to be trading cards, 3D models, text-based companions, VR animations, and much much more. Keeping the base art simple, allows for maxium building possibility, while still being cute to begin with :3</p>

                        <p>These NFTs aren't just a "pfp" series, they carry rich metadata that will help build the future metaverse adaptations around it. Things like names, stats, lore, attributes, and more! Think of minting these NFTs like a baby, which will eventually grow into complex & incredibly interesting creatures. They evolve based on community engagement.</p>

                        <p>This is smartly done using a "carrot & stick" approach. People who participate in this community (<em>building games, making apps, sharing tutorials, onboarding new users</em>) will earn a companion token which, among other utility, will serve as a governance token in a DAO. This DAO will grant funding to new project proposals (<em>that everyone is free to pitch & vote on</em>), guide marketing efforts, and host interactive events (<em>imagine a colosseum full of frens watching you have pokemon-like card battles with someone from around the world</em>).<br><br>In addition to community efforts, I'm personally lining up partnership with other projects & teams, as well as building my own experiences that will help make FRENFTs an attractive & fun web3 adventure for everyone to participate in.
